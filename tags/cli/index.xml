A while ago, I discovered k9s and it made working with Kubernetes clusters so much simpler. To quote the description directly from the k9s site:
K9s is a terminal based UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters
Installing k9s is written in go-lang. The beauty of programs written in that language is that they are compiled down to a single binary with all the dependencies included.</description></item></channel></rss>
