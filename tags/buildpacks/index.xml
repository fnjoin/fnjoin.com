This is because leveraging spring-boot solves so many other problems for the developer and speeds up the overall development process. In other words, we are OK with more developer productivity at the cost of higher resource usage at runtime specially at application startup.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes with Java - Creating Images</title><link>https://fnjoin.com/post/2021-11-28-creating-images/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@fnjoin.com (Salman Malik, Archie Cowan)</author><guid>https://fnjoin.com/post/2021-11-28-creating-images/</guid><description>Building production quality images for Java apps To run a spring-boot app on k8s, you need to create a container image. The images need to be in the Open Container Image format. In this article, we will review how to create OCI images two different ways:
Using a Dockerfile Using Cloud Native Buildpacks Note: The Open Container Image (OCI) format antecedent of the Docker image format as a standard specification.</description></item></channel></rss>
